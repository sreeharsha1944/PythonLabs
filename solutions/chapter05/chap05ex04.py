""" A Solution For Chapter 5 Exercise 4
    There is a built-in function in Python called sum that will return the
    sum of all of the numbers of an iterable object.
    • Write a similar function, but instead of taking a collection as a
      parameter, the function should take a variable number of arguments
      and return the sum of them.

    Rewrite the above function  to return a tuple instead of a sum.
    • The tuple should be the sum and the average of all of the
      arguments passed to the function.
