""" A Solution For Chapter 5 Exercise 1
    Write and test a function that is designed to validate input.
    • The function should prompt the user for a positive integer.
    • It should validate the information entered by the user is indeed a
      positive integer.
    • If number entered is valid, the function should return the number.
    • If the number entered is invalid, the function should return a zero
     (0) instead.
    • The application, not the function, should indicate with a message in
      the output each time an invalid entry is given.
